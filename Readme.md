# Mirai

A high-performance programming language focused on simplicity, productivity and speed.

> The program is currently under the heavy development and isn't ready for use

## Features

- Near native speed execution
- Simple and clean syntax
- Statically typed
- Memory safe
- Built-in productivity tools [todo]
- Automatic error correction [todo]

## Example

```rs
i64 add(i64 a, i64 b) {
    a + b
}

i64 sum = 0
i64 i = 0

while i < 1000000 {
    sum = add(sum, i)
    i = i + 1
}

print sum
```

## Performance

Mirai achieves near-native performance, much faster than any other interpreted language:

- Mirai: ~3ms
- Node.js: ~40ms (13x faster)
- Python: ~1s (333x faster)
